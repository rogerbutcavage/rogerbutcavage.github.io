  <h1>Hello. I'm Roger!</h1>

  <p>
  I'm one of only 14 people in the world who hold a law degree
  <i>in addition to</i> a Ph.D. in soil science! But really, enough about me,
  I'd love to get to know you!
  Please check out my OKCupid profile,
  and if you might be interested, send me a message!
